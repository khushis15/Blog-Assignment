        <p class="text-muted text-left">Jaipur's Hawa Mahal (Wind Palace) is undoubtedly one of the most distinctive monuments in India. It's certainly the most iconic landmark in Jaipur. The building's evocative facade, with all those little windows, never fails to arouse curiosity.Apparently, the Hawa Mahal has an innumerable 953 jharokhas (windows)! The royal women used to sit behind them to watch the city below without being seen. A cooling breeze flowed through the windows, giving rise to the name "Wind Palace". </p>

        <p class="text-muted text-left" >As the name suggests, the sand accumulated in the Goa Beach resembles the ones in Goa. If you want to have fun sitting on the beach, this is a great place to visit. You can enjoy magnificent sea beaches in Rishikesh itself. This white sand beach is a famous picnic spot where you can see a large number of tourists sunbathing. The surrounding area is very beautiful and taking a walk gives you an experience similar to the one you will get in Goa. The cool evening breeze makes this place more soothing and beautiful.</p>

            <p>The spiky and majestic "Black Adam" is one of the best DC superhero films to date. This tale of a gloomy, seemingly malevolent god who reappears in a long-occupied Middle Eastern nation rejects most of the choices that bland-ify even the good entries in the genre.We finally have that Black Adam movie, which is just as brutal and action packed as the Rock has always promised. ... I had a blast.</p>

            <p> An event film of sorts, since it marks Shah Rukh Khanâ€™s return to the big screen after four long years, Pathaan is an ambitious action thriller that plays to the gallery and lives up to the hype. Far-fetched in writing but high on star power and style, Pathaan initially seems like a filmy Mountain Dew commercial which slowly but steadily finds its footing.</p>

            <p> From one creepy holiday to another, both unravel at exotic sea-side locations and closely observe rich people with ambiguous intent and suspicious behaviour. Mysterious deaths lie at the bottom of both the plots so let the holidays begin!.A deliciously twisty remix of the classic British-style murder mystery, with a fabulous location and a group of suspects who all have motive and opportunity. Also like its predecessor, it has an all-star cast clearly enjoying themselves enormously.</p>
